## Fish Pole

Factorio mod that adds a big electric pole, placeable under the water.

Do you think electric poles spanning bodies of water seem out of place or maybe they are an obstacle?
Do you build landfill lily pad islands or build floating electric poles?
Have you wished there was an underwater electric cable to span bodies of water?
With these poles, your waterways will be unimpeded.

The pole appears as a swimming fish, but unlike a fish, it does not move.

Wire connections are hidden by default, startup setting to make them visible.
Startup settings for maxiumum wire reach and supply area, defaults set to vanilla big electric pole.

### Compatibility
Should work with most other mods, depending on the amount of electric pole manipulation.
