## Fish Pole

Factorio mod that adds a big electrical pole, placeable under the water.

Think electrical poles over water seems odd or maybe they are an obstacle?
Wish there was an underwater electrical cable to span bodies of water?
With these poles your water ways are unimpeded.

The pole appears as a swimming fish, but unlike a fish, it does not move.

Wire connections are hidden by default, startup setting to make them visible.

### Compatibility
Should work with most other mods, depends on the amount of electrical pole manipulation.
Adjustments made to the big electric pole via the PoleRanger mod, apply to the fish pole.
