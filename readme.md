## Fish Pole

Factorio mod that adds a big electrical pole, placeable under the water.

Think electrical poles over water seems odd or maybe they are an obstacle?
Wish there was an underwater electical cable to span bodies of water?
With these poles your water ways are unimpeded.

The pole appears as a swimming fish, but unlike a fish, it does not move.

Wire connections are hidden by default, startup setting to make them visable.

### Compatibility
Should work with most other mods, depends on the amount of electrical pole manipulation.
